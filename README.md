# ionic-build-stack

Prints out any relevant version info for your ionic project's build stack.

Note, this is not necessary, as `ionic -v` will get you the same thing, but much better. I am only creating this project as a sort of "Hello World".

Run it like this:

`ionicbs`

or

`ionic-build-stack `

or

`ionic-build-info`
